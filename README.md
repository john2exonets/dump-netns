# dump-netns
Simple shell script to print out in a formatted manner all the IP addresses in the local IP Namespaces.

I used to use this when troubleshooting OpenStack setups.  I used PHP for the IP Address check part of the script, becuase at the time, that was the only other default programming language on the node that I was working on....feel free to substitute with something in a language you are more familar with ;)

Takes an optional IP address and will show you what IP Namespace it is located in.
